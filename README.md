My name is Jayden Vause.

I am an aspiring developer from NSW Australia and for three years, I have been completing my Diploma of Information Technology.
I was studying part-time due to health issues, with 5 units remaining I am due to complete it by the end of 2022. I strive to be the best version of myself.

I am aspiring to build my professional portfolio and pursue a career in computer programming. I have undertaken self-taught learning on the side in addition to my Diploma. I am passionate about developing my skills in the areas of website development, including software architecture/development, SOLID Principles, KISS/DRY, MVC, Object-oriented programming, strong coding practices, and documentation.

Furthermore, I created a portfolio website using Raw PHP 8. I made a basic web framework using PHP and an MVC pattern to sharpen my skills in understanding TDD, MVC, and Backend Development. The address is https://www.jaydenvausedesigns.com
Everything was done using vanilla code and in no way did I receive any 3rd party code to make this website. It is somewhat nice looking but fairly basic in nature, however, the backend framework programming was a great experience in learning how it all pieced together.

Additionally, I have a GitHub with a few years of VERY SIMPLE programming practice uploads and commits, I am familiar with version control, ubuntu, and windows OS.  

I value the opportunity to expand my knowledge in website development and the ability to work collaboratively with a team of like-minded individuals.

If you have any inquiries, feel free to reach out and I will help where I can. 

Kind Regards,


Jayden Vause
